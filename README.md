# LUFY: A RAG Chatbot that forgets unimportant conversations

This repository contains the code and dataset for the paper titled "____" (add the paper title here). LUFY is a RAG-based chatbot designed to forget unimportant conversations, managing to forget over 90% of irrelevant content!

## Getting Started

To quickly start using the chatbot, please refer to the [README in the Code directory](./Code/README.md) for detailed instructions on how to set up, run, and interact with LUFY.

## Dataset

We are also releasing a new dataset that is 4.5x larger than any existing text-based conversation dataset, structured as follows:
/Dataset/{System Name}/{User Name}/{Session Number}/{Annotation Number}.xlsx

- **System Name**: The specific chatbot system used.
- **User Name**: The pseudonym or identifier for the user.
- **Session Number**: A sequential number for each conversation session.
- **Annotation Number**: Specific annotations made during the session.

## Additional Information

For more details on the project, including the methodology and results, please refer to our paper [here](link).
