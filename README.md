This is the code and the dataset for the paper "".
The RAG chatbot that forgets unimportant conversations (forgets more than 90%!).

Please refer to README in Code to see how to run and talk to the chatbot.

We also release the dataset collected, which is 4.5x longer than any existing text-based conversation dataset. 

The dataset is structured as follows:
